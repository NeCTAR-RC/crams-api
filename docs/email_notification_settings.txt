In order to support the email notification, you have to configure the email settings in local/local_settings.py or in crams_app/settings.py

please copy the following lines from local_settings.py.example to your local_settings.py or crams_app/settings.py

# Email notification configuration
EMAIL_SENDER = 'admin@crams.org.au'

# Send email to the console by default
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
# Or have an smtp backend, it will send email to admin user
# EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
# django-mailer uses a different settings attribute
MAILER_EMAIL_BACKEND = EMAIL_BACKEND

# Configure these for outgoing email server
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.monash.edu'
# EMAIL_PORT = 25
# EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'crams_admin'
# EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'crams_admin_password'
